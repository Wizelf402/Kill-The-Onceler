BRING BACK THE FUCKIN' TREES, LADS 'N LASSES

Alrighty. So, here's the deal.
We've got the Wither Theme song, we've got the stupid snow pigs which just kinda randomly peace out from the modpack...
But this is WAY bigger than either of those. Without the wither theme... the Wither just doesn't have a theme. Without Snow Pigs, I would just have to create another starting food source. 

But without the lush caves? That's part of Permafrost's story gone. That's the key to surviving the earlygame gone. That's some really, REALLY beautiful places gone. 
But the main mod of the pack, Primal Winter, is incompatible with BGCore, the library mod for the Caves & Cliffs Backport I'm using to get the lush caves in here.

Both of these mods drastically change how the world is generated... and when they clash, every single tree in the world decides to just peace the fuck out.
We need a solution. I need y'all to tear this final beta version of Permafrost to goddamn SHREDS to try and find a way for these two mods to coexist.

This modpack may be the apocalypse, but, like... the apocalypse is better than the fucking Onceler.

Again. Thanks. All of you.
